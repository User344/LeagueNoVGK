# LeagueNoVGK
Simple tool to make Riot Client think that Vanguard is disabled and League of Legends does not need it, to be able to launch LCU with Vanguard disabled/uninstalled.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is **NOT** a Vanguard bypass. This will **NOT** let you play League of Legends without Vanguard. It only lets you launch LCU without it.

# Usage
1. Close Riot Client.

2. Launch the app.

Thats it.
